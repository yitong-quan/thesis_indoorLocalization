//Import Ccode into simplicity studio with

//Matlab same R to generate noise

//test simplify

//Change the value of factor_Q to 1 in all KF_traj_noise_meas_...

//% <<<<<<<<TODO: 01 instead of 1

...execle to record the mismatch R Q #NODEDS ...

//randomly set the num of missing measurements in each set

//trimmean,  mad

//find out the nodes_position from 'uwb03-Unnamed__Time_Position.mat'

//calib the experiment data frome HTerm back to true value

//dist from HTerm shoild substract the height from the ground

debug the hardware ,looks like I have only changed the waitiong time from 6 to 2s in the basis, should also chang somewhere in the nodes 
find out the location of the nodes
calibration is good- only seems changing from time to time
and 0x4D4D calib is not good
RTC_delay_ms    RTC_start    RTC_init
NODE LED 6S when no ID is written in the basic


design the location to place the nodes, the dist among them should be different, so that it is easier to be recgonized
dt too big, try to seperate dt into smaller ddt

find out the respond_time stamp in each output(HTerm & MoCap)
