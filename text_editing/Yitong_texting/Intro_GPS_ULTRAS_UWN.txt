In sharp contrast to the capability of obtaining centimeterlevel
accuracy of positioning under clear sky view, GPS fails to
perform under indoor environment as its signal power levels
are not sufficient for indoor applications [7]. Nonetheless,
indoor GPS could be established through the deployment of
pseudolites; GPS signal transmitters which enhance the signal
availability as well as replace the GPS satellite constellation for
indoor applications. 

The
ability of the UWB technology to provide non-line-of-sight
(NLOS) positioning is another advantage that the UWB system
has over the indoor GPS system.

The GPS provides world-wide coverage to allow its users to
obtain position information through its optimum satellite 
constellation. The satellites are arranged in such a way that at
any location and point of time, the GPS receiver could receive
signals from 4 to 11 satellites. In other words, the satellite
constellation allows up to 7 satellites to be in view for 80% of
the time,

For indoor GPS, multipath error is the
dominant error source, where multipath could be a result from
buildings as well as the surfaces of the indoor infrastructures.
