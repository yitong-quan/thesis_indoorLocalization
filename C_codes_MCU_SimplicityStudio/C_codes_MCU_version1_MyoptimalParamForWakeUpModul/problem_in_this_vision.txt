wake_up parameters have been tuned optimal, when only one node is used, performs really good.

but still when 6 nodes or 5 nodes are used at the same time, some just cannot be waked up
	node 0x1C1C can be waked up almost every called, but others cannot
		it is not due to the order of wake_up_ID, because I have try put the ID of 0x1C1C at the end of the sequence of ID for wakeup command
		so it must be the problem of the hardware, otherwise the 0x1C1C cannot perform so good
-------------

what is going to be  done in the next version is to disable the wakeup modul, or
not going to sleep for minutes after each wake up
